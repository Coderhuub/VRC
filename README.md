## Overview
The Error Detection Techniques project aims to demonstrate the implementation of the Vertical Redundancy Check algorithm for error detection. Two implementations are provided: one for binary data and another for string data.

## Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/error-detection-techniques.git

Choose the implementation you want to run:

1. VRC Binary: Compile and run the vrc_binary.cpp file using a C++ compiler.
2. VRC String: Compile and run the vrc_string.cpp file using a C++ compiler.
Follow the instructions provided within each implementation to input the data and perform the error detection.
